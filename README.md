To analyze the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on student performance.
To study performance patterns across Math, Reading, and Writing.
To generate insights that help educators improve academic outcomes.
Covers student performance in three subjects: math, reading, and writing.
Focuses on categorical variables such as gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, parental education level, and test preparation course.
Aims to provide insights into how non-academic factors influence performance, useful for educators, policymakers, and academic institutions.
Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the StudentsPerformance dataset, which contains exam scores and demographic details of students.
The goal is to explore factors that influence academic performance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset StudentsPerformance.csv includes the following columns:

gender → Student’s gender (male/female)

race/ethnicity → Student’s ethnic group

parental level of education → Highest education level of parents

lunch → Type of lunch (standard/free/reduced)

test preparation course → Whether a test prep course was completed

math score → Student’s math exam score

reading score → Student’s reading exam score

writing score → Student’s writing exam score

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Analyze score distribution across different groups

Identify factors influencing performance (gender, parental education, lunch type, etc.)

Visualize findings using charts and graphs

Build insights that can help in educational decision-making

📊 Example Analyses
